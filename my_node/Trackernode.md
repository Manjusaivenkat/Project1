here I initialized the  the node app by 
`npm init`
the create an file `app.js`

in package.json i given script as  `"start": "node app.js"`

so when i do `npm start` it will run the given command

after that I installed `express , cors , body parser`.

then created `.env` to define separate node port for Node server. ofcourse , we can define directly by app.listen but I used in this way for the better practice.

see the comments defined in the respective file for the further explaination
