18/02/2023:
To sync this with gitHub i did.
    => git init
    => git remote add origin "<repo_name>"
To install the react, I did :
    => npx create-react-app <project_name>
after doing this react is installed, to start the server . 
I have to do "npm start" after entering into project folder. by doing this we will see a logo.

Now I want to change the port number. Initially it will start with "3000"
by giving ".env" we will give the configuration for the UI server but we should follow the nomenclature    
Ex: PORT=<port_number>
by following this the React app can able to get the port number
